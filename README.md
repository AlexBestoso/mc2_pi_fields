# mc2_pi_fields
Experimental code for properly calculating MC2 and the relative pi fields described by Einstien 

The equation appears to work as expected; but in my quest to simplfiy things, I've somewhat broken the field generation.

In this current experimental version, you can fix field generation by using the mc2 function directectly and setting the j loop to 7 increments and the i loop to 3.
